**Strategy**

 - Using SMA for 100, 40, and 10 days
 - Wait for MA 10 to drop below 40 - signal to short stock - point one in Fibonacci extension (take average of last month)
 - Wait for MA 100 to rise above MA 40 - signal to go long on stock - point two in Fibonacci extension - (take average of last month)
 - Calculate Fibonacci retracement - go long
 - Exit when retracement levels are met
